Workspace containing all the bash scripts that I coded for my personal needs.

## How to learn bash

If you already know at least one programming language, I suggest you to learn bash scripting using [Code Learning Dojo](https://learn-bash.org/hello-world.html) which gives you the fundamental of bash language with some basic training exercises (It is the learning flow that I followed and it was pretty fast to be able start writing your first own scripts). After that, you could rely on internet (especially overstackflow) whenever you need to find a solution for any specific problems.
